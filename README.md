This project is an application allowing users to search for tracks on Spotify in order to create their own playlists and be able to save them on the Spotify accounts.

* **React** : building a multi-component web app using props and hooks
* **Spotify web API** : authentication (Spotify OAuth flow), REST APIs, asynchronous functions and HTTP requests

..* remove tracks from the playlist.
