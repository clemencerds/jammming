This project is an application allowing users to search for tracks on Spotify in order to create their own playlists and be able to save them on the Spotify accounts.

## Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project was to practice and solidify my knowledge of React and API calls among others technologies.  


## Technologies used

* **React** : building a multi-component web app using props and hooks
* **Spotify web API** : authentication (Spotify OAuth flow), REST APIs, asynchronous functions and HTTP requests
* **CSS modules** : modular approach for component-specific design. Responsive design. Design the best user experience
* **Git and Github** : version control and project hosting


## Features

* **API authentication** : a secure user experience through Spotify's OAuth flow

* **Track search** : 
  * search for tracks in the Spotify library by title, artist or album name.
  * display of tracks details in the search results : title, artist and album. 

* **Playlist management** : 
  * browse through the search results to add tracks to the user's own playlist. 
  * remove tracks from the playlist.
  * Change the name of the playlist. 
  * Add it to the user's Spotify account.


## Future enhancements

* add the possibility to listen to a sample of the tracks in the search results before adding a track to a playlist.
